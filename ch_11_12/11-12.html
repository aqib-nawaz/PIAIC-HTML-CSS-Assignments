           <h3>Cloud Native Computing</h3>
        	 <p>The <strong>Cloud Native Computing</strong> program prepares the students to program in open source
             technologies like, <span><em>Linux, Docker, Kubernetes, JavaScript, Node.js, React and React Native</em></span>
             while introducing the students to development of Microservices  
             and software development
           </p>	
        </section>
        <section id="Ai">
        	<h3>Artificial Intelligence</h3>
        	<p>The <strong>artificial intelligence</strong> program of PIAIC takes the student through the foundation of the AI
            technology, via teaching programming in open source languages like <span><em>Python, Numpy, Pandas,
            Tensorflow 2.0 and Flask,</em></span> and teaching deploying practical AI solutions and use cases, and
            ending with real-life examples of modern day AI in practice.
           </p>
        </section>
        <section id="Bc">
        	<h3>Blockchain</h3>
        	<p>The main emphasis of <strong>Blockchain program</strong> is to understand the blockchains like <span><em>Ethereum
            and Hyperledger (Fabric),</em></span>and learn to program in languages such as Solidity, JavaScript on
            frameworks like Node.js. The program also introduces them to development of Distributed Apps
            (DApps), frameworks like Web3 and Truffle and an in-depth understanding of Blockchain-as-aservice (BaaS) and how to develop and offer an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) of a crypto-token</p>
        </section>
        <section id="IoT">
        	<h3>Internet Of Things</h3>
        	<p>The <strong>Internet of things </strong>program introduces the students to open source development
            technologies like<span><em> Rust, Embedded Rust, WebAssembly, Hyper, Diesel, Google Assistant,
            and Kubernetes </em></span> while making them efficient in developing Micro Services for IoT Edge, IoT
           Cloud, and voice computing for device control.
